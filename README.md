## Breakout-Board (passive) for the Wino-Board

This is a breadboard compatible Breakout-Board for the WinoBOARD (http://wino-board.com). The WinoBOARD comes with 2.0 mm spaced pin headers, so you can NOT use it with any standard (solder-less) breadboard / prototyping PCB (stripes or holes) out of the box...

###Features:

- pin spacing 0,1 inch / 100 mil / 2,54 mm
- 900 mil (22.86 mm) spacing between the 2 outer rows of pin headers
therefore it fits on every standard (solder-less) breadboard / prototyping PCB (stripes or holes)
- smallest possible size: 25,4 mm x 35,56mm (1 inch x 1,4 inch)
- "sorted" I/Os (see picture)
- you may solder the WinoBOARD directly onto the this Breakout-Board or use (2mm-pin-spacing) sockets (recommended)
- cut-out in ground-plane for not disturbing the WiFi antenna
- has 2 mounting holes [2,2 mm] for M2-screws (e.g. for later use within another housing / or with your own projects)

This Breakout-Board is completely "passive" (no active components), that means, you have to manage the power supply (3.3V) and USB-connection and reset-button by yourself, or you use the USB-/Battery upgrade (http://wino-board.com/upgrades/usb-battery-upgrade) which is of course usable (stackable) with this Breakout-Board as well.
